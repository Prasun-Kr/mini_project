## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Was net to git so it was a bit challanging for me. The commands and all was new for me. I took some reference from the internet to understand them better.
2. Had problems in unit testing part.
3. I tried to learn and implement the commands as well as the concepts.
4. Making the makefile was bit challanging. I asked for some help from my friends and it worked.

## Github Actions

1. Build using Make for Continuous Integration
2. Unit tests with Cunit
3. Static code analysis using cppcheck
4. Dynamic Code analysis using valgrind
