# Requirements
## Introduction
Main aim of this application is to provide the details of the type of vehicles parked and the amount collected from the parking of different vehicles. It will help us in maintaining the transaction and other records in an easy and effective way.

## Research

Survey for parked vehicle count and parking
capacity was carried out on different days(weekdays and weekends). 
The respective count were noted in the tabular form. 
To avoid the violation of traffic rules as well as traffic Congestion, there is need for organized parking facility which can accommodate more number of required vehicles.


## Cost and Features

Cost:

This system is basically meant to store details of the amount collected from the vehicles parked in the parking area. So, the cost here is the time required to keep the database updated, ensuring there is no wrong data entered as well as the application works systematically and smoothly without any problems.

Features:

The main features of this application are: 
- It stores the amount generated from different types of vehicles. 
- It can show the status of different vehicles parked and the amount collected.
- Once the vehicle went out of the parking area, it will be removed/deleted.


## Defining Our System

- User can choose from the menu what would they like to park (bike, car, bus).
- Accoding to the option they will be able to alter it.
- They can check the status, delete, or exit. 
- Any wrong key or exit choice will lead to termination of program.

## SWOT ANALYSIS

S(strength) - Easy to handle with good basic functionalities.
            - Low cost and easy to build

W(weakness) - Cannot keep the record of vehicle number.
            - Not secure
            - We can go for smart parking management system by installing cctv cameras at different parking areas.

O(oppurtunities) - we can work on maintaining the database of different vehicle by their numbers. It will be helpful for the further analysis and will also be helpful from security point of view.

T(threats) - we are not keeping the record of the vehicle numbers so there may be any security issue where there is a need for the vehicles detail. we are just keeping the record of the types of vehicles parked and not the details of the exact vehicle.
